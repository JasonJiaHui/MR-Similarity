# MR-Similarity

This project is mainly about how to compute similairty(Jaccard) among the big data.

Actually, the similarity among items acts as the big role in machine learning, especially on pattern recognition.

The logic of MR to compute similairy is not complex, however the efficiency and runtime would be bottle neck, in order to 
get reasonable efficiency and runtime, we should implement algorithm in the paper provided.

Finally, run our program in AWS and to discover the power of distributed system.
